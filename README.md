# FTB Quests: Forcibly Translated

[中文](README_zh.md)

Most of modpacks doesn't provide a _translatable_ quests that translators have to hardly modify their quests to
translate it.

This mod does a runtime, non-breaking injection to the quests GUI that transform the untranslatable components to
translatable ones.

**More details in the Chinese README.**
